         Baju Streetwear





         Streetwear fashion is a clothing style

         that is heavily influenced by
         urbanites, youth culture and hip-hop.
         This can be seen in relaxed casual
         clothing such as oversized t-shirts,
         hoodies and sneakers. Streetwear

         designs often feature bold graphic
         elements, such as large logos and
         photography. And it is often said to be

         a form of self-expression.]]></page><page Index="3"><![CDATA[PROJECT]]></page><page Index="4"><![CDATA[DESAIN
